# NOpfs!

NOPfs helps IPFS to say No!

NOPfs is an implementation of
[IPIP-383](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/383) which add supports for
content blocking to the go-ipfs stack and particularly to Kubo.

NOPfs is quite alpha because:
  * Depends on functionality that was recently introduced to Kubo (so it requires using master)
  * Not fully optimized or tweakable

As soon as we can build a plugin on top of a stable version of Kubo (or
provide a painless approach to it), we will.

The list of blocked content is managed via denylist files which have the following syntax:

```

## Using with Kubo

The plugin works with [Kubo@a6f446a4bab78b3d8b814474f1532f7bebcdc9c1](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/tree/a6f446a4bab78b3d8b814474f1532f7bebcdc9c1), with the following caveats:

  - `go.mod` has a replace directive. It should point to your local kubo git repository.
  - You should build the `ipfs` binary manually from the local kubo repo: `cd cmd/ipfs; CGO_ENABLED=1 go build`. Do not use `make build`.
  - Running `make plugin-install` (here on the nopfs repo) will build and install the `nopfs.so` plugin into `~/.ipfs/plugins`.

From that point, starting Kubo should load the plugin and automatically work with denylists (files with extension `.deny`) found in `/etc/ipfs/denylists` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ipfs/denylists` (usually `~/.config/ipfs/denylists`).

We will be improving these instructions once we can work on mainline Kubo.
